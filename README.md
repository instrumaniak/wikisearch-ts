# WikiPedia Search: TypeScript version

This port uses different tech stacks of React:

- TypeScript
- React hooks
- Material UI

This project is based on my old projects:

- [Using Bootstrap](https://codepen.io/instrumaniak/pen/NybJEZ)
- [React Native version](https://github.com/instrumaniak/wikiSearch)
